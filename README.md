# PIWildCam

A device running off a raspberry pi 3+ - to capture audio using a PIR sensor for recording at a badger sett; we wanted to keep recording
without disturbing the environment and get an insight into the lives of badgers throughout the year so we are currently developing this as an ongoing
project.
Elements include for first experimental version;

1. Raspberry pi 3+ in an enclosure
2. IP Camera - RTSP compatible.
3. Audio Interface - Zoom H1n
4. PIR Sensor
5. USB Pen Drive
6. Solar Panel 12v - 140w
7. Solar Panel Controller - Volt Controller
8. 12v Battery 100ah
9. 12v Wind Turbine

Following the original design and further research into the subject, the above is a bit out of date; although still works as a system.
I have now created a better version with UPS system from PiJuice. The above version was really impractical for badgers location and just caused many issues at the site.
Here are the latest components: 
date of upgrade 07/12/2023.

1. PiJuice Hat
2. Raspiberry Pi Zero 2.
3. Seeed audio hat (stereo)
4. USB Pen Drive
5. Waveshare Solar powered battery pack (10000mah)
6. 18v 10w Solar Panel
7. Portable wifi Router.
8. Picamera NOIR module. 

The final working version of this project is now using a, as of march 2024: 

1. PI4.
2. Rode AI Micro
3. Waveshare Solar powered battery pack
4. 18v 110w Solar Panel
5. Picamera NOIR Module
6. PIR SENSOR
7. USB PEN DRIVE
   

The PI takes some setting up but works fairly well in all, after much testing!
