# PIWildCam
A device running off a raspberry pi 3+ - to capture audio using a PIR sensor for recording at a badger sett; we wanted to keep recording
without disturbing the environment and get an insight into the lives of badgers throughout the year so we are currently developing this as an ongoing
project.
Elements include
1. Raspberry pi 3+ in an enclosure
2. IP Camera
3. Audio Interface
4. PIR Sensor
5. USB Drive
6. Solar Panel
7. Solar Panel Controller
8. 12v Battery

The PI takes some setting up but works fairly well in all, after much testing!
