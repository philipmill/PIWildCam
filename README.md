# PIWildCam
A device running off a raspberry pi 3+ - to capture audio using a PIR sensor for recording at a badger sett; we wanted to keep recording
without disturbing the environment and get an insight into the lives of badgers throughout the year so we are currently developing this as an ongoing
project.
Elements include
1. Raspberry pi 3+ in an enclosure
2. IP Camera - RTSP compatible.
3. Audio Interface - Zoom H1n
4. PIR Sensor
5. USB Drive
6. Solar Panel 30v
7. Solar Panel Controller - Volt Controller
8. 12v Battery 9ah x2

The PI takes some setting up but works fairly well in all, after much testing!
